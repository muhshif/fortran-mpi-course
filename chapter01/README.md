# Chapter 1: Getting Started with Fortran

Welcome to Chapter 1 of the **Fortran & MPI for Climate Modeling** course! ðŸŽ‰

This chapter introduces Fortran programming for complete beginners, especially those working in climate science. You'll write and run your first few Fortran programs â€” no previous experience required.

---

## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn
- Why Fortran is still important in climate models like ICON
- How to install and use the `gfortran` compiler
- How to write, compile, and run basic Fortran programs

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Programs
All programs are included in this folder:
- `hello.f90`: prints "Hello, world!"
- `temp_convert.f90`: converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
- `sum_two_numbers.f90`: adds two numbers entered by the user

To compile and run, use:
```bash
gfortran hello.f90 -o hello
./hello
